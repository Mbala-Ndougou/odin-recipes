    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my absolute favorite snack. It's a hundred percent natural and healthy, but make sure not to become addicted as it is really high in calories</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>To make this, we'll need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Peanuts</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's really easy to do:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the peanuts with a blender. I like to keep some bits in mine for texture but you can grind it to full smoothness if you want</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt and a scoop of honey</li>
        <li>Mix with a spoon and put in a container of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Voil√†! You've got a delicious peanut butter to eat anytime! Enjoy!</p>
